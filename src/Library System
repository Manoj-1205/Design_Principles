Certainly! Here's a simple question that adheres to all SOLID principles:

Question: Design a system for a library that manages books, patrons, and borrowing transactions. 
The system should allow patrons to borrow and return books, while ensuring proper validation and tracking of book availability.

Requirements:

1. The system should maintain a catalog of books with information such as title, author, genre, and availability.
2. Patrons should be able to search for books by title or author.
3. Patrons should be able to borrow books from the library, and the system should enforce limits on the number of books a patron can borrow.
4. The system should track borrowing transactions, including due dates and overdue fees.
5. The system should provide a notification system to alert patrons about approaching due dates and overdue books.

Your task:
Design a system for the library that adheres to all SOLID principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), 
Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). 
Consider how to structure the classes, define their responsibilities, and manage their interactions to ensure a modular, flexible, and maintainable system.

You can start by identifying the high-level classes, their responsibilities,
 and how they interact with each other to fulfill the requirements. Think about how to separate concerns, 
 establish proper abstractions or interfaces, and minimize dependencies between components. 
 Consider how you can handle the borrowing, returning, and tracking of books, as well as the communication with patrons for notifications.

Once you've designed the system, provide an overview of the classes, their responsibilities, 
and how they adhere to each SOLID principle to create a well-structured and robust library management system.
